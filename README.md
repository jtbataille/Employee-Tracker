This application, however, can be suit itself to the database of the user by modifying the connection information housed within the ```server.js``` file.

The user is able to use the following command in an integrated terminal to run the application:

<code>node server.js</code>

This command will then query the user with various options related to the database, such as "View All Employees," "Add New Employee," "Update Employee Role," etc. The information will be provided to the user in a table-form using ```console.table```.

Finally, the user can end the connection by selecting "Exit" from the list of options within the CLI.
